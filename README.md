# Google_ads_keywords
Source code of python which generate keywords for google ads using defined keywords

First need to generate a list of words, that together with the products given by you would make for good keywords. Here are some 
examples:
   
   • Products: laptop, mobile 
    • Words: buy, prices 
    
    
The resulting keywords: 'buy laptop', 'laptop buy', 'buy mobile', 'mobile buy', 'prices laptop', 'laptop prices', 'prices mobile', 'mobile prices'.

#SAVE AND UPLOAD

To upload our campaign, you need to save it as a CSV file. Then we will be able to import it to AdWords editor or BingAds editor. There is also the option of pasting the data into the editor if we want, but having easy access to the saved data is great so let's save to a CSV file!
